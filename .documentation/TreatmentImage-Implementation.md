# TreatmentImage Component Implementation

## Overview
The TreatmentImage component has been created to standardize image handling across the website. This component provides a consistent way to display treatment-related images with proper fallbacks and styling.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
The TreatmentImage component accepts the following props:
- `category`: The treatment category (e.g., "body-care", "new-doublo")
- `treatment`: The specific treatment (e.g., "hair-removal", "v-line")
- `type`: The image type (hero, how-it-works, benefits, etc.)
- `index`: Optional index number for types that have multiple images
- `alt`: Alt text for accessibility
- Additional image props like `className`, `fill`, `width`, `height`, etc.

### Pages Updated
- **New Doublo Page**: Updated testimonial avatars and benefits section images
- **Hair Removal Page**: Updated all treatment images throughout the page

### Testing
- Created dedicated tests for TreatmentImage component in `tests/components/treatment-image.spec.ts`
- Updated page tests to work with the new component implementation
- Added specific image tests to verify proper rendering

## Benefits
1. **Standardized Image Handling**: Consistent approach across the site
2. **Automatic Fallbacks**: Handles missing images gracefully
3. **Organized Structure**: Clear categorization of images by treatment and type
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to update image handling in one place
5. **Responsive Design**: Consistent responsive behavior across device sizes

## Next Steps
1. Update remaining treatment pages to use TreatmentImage component
2. Create consistent placeholder images for all categories and types
3. Standardize image naming conventions across the site
4. Expand test coverage for TreatmentImage component

## Folder Structure
Images are organized following this pattern:
```
/public/images/treatments/[category]/[treatment]/[type]-[index].jpg
```

For example:
```
/public/images/treatments/body-care/hair-removal/how-it-works-1.jpg
/public/images/treatments/new-doublo/v-line/hero.jpg
```

## Fallback System
When an image isn't found, the component falls back to:
```
/public/images/placeholders/[category]/[type].jpg
```

## Technical Implementation
The component uses React's `useEffect` to handle image loading and error states, providing appropriate fallbacks when needed. It also supports both fill mode for hero images and fixed sizing for other image types.
