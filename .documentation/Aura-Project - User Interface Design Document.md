# User Interface Design Document: Project Aura

**Chosen UI Direction:** Tech-Forward Clarity

## 1. Layout Structure

*   **Overall:** Clean, highly structured grid-based layout. Strong emphasis on clear visual hierarchy and logical flow.
*   **Spacing:** Generous use of white space to reduce cognitive load and enhance the feeling of precision and clarity. Consistent margins and padding rules will be applied.
*   **Alignment:** Strict alignment of elements (text, images, buttons, icons) to create a sense of order and professionalism. Left-alignment preferred for text blocks in English and Chinese for readability.
*   **Key Sections:**
    *   **Header:** Minimalist, likely containing the Aura logo, primary navigation (Services, Aura Circle, Booking), language selector, and account access/login.
    *   **Footer:** Standard links (Contact, About variations, T&Cs, Privacy Policy), potentially social media icons, and copyright info. Kept clean and unobtrusive.
    *   **Main Content Area:** Adapts based on page type (e.g., service details, booking flow, user dashboard). Information is presented in clear, digestible blocks or sections.
    *   **Sidebars (Conditional):** May be used sparingly for filtering options (e.g., on service listing pages) or contextual navigation within complex sections (e.g., user account dashboard).

## 2. Core Components

*   **Buttons:** Clear, distinct call-to-action buttons with straightforward labels (e.g., "Book Now", "View Details", "Add to Cart", "Redeem Tokens"). Consistent styling for primary, secondary, and tertiary actions. Crisp edges, potentially subtle hover states.
*   **Forms:** Simple, clean input fields with clear labels. Minimal visual clutter. Obvious focus states. Validation messages should be clear and concise. Multi-step forms (like booking) will use progress indicators.
*   **Navigation:** Intuitive primary navigation (header). Breadcrumbs for deeper pages. User account/dashboard navigation will be clear and likely sidebar-based or tabbed within the account section.
*   **Cards:** Used potentially for service summaries, blog post previews, or product listings. Clean design with clear separation between image/icon, title, short description, and action/price.
*   **Icons:** Prominent use of modern, clean, line-style icons representing service categories, key features (AI Scan, Tokens, Virtual Consult), benefits, or status indicators. Icons must be instantly recognizable and visually consistent.
*   **Data Visualization:** Simple, clear charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, progress rings) used primarily for AI scan results, membership tier progress, or Token balance/history. Focus on conveying key information quickly, avoiding complex or decorative visualizations.
*   **Modals/Pop-ups:** Used for critical alerts, quick confirmation steps, or focused tasks (like login). Design will be consistent with the overall clean aesthetic, avoiding intrusive behaviour.

## 3. Interaction Patterns

*   **Feedback:** Crisp, immediate visual feedback on interactions (button clicks, form submissions, hover states). Avoid overly elaborate animations; focus on responsiveness.
*   **Transitions:** Minimal and fast page transitions or component loading states (e.g., subtle fades or quick slide-ins). Performance is key.
*   **Booking Flow:** Highly streamlined, multi-step process with clear progress indication. Minimize clicks and required inputs. Real-time validation where possible.
*   **Filtering/Sorting:** Intuitive controls (checkboxes, dropdowns, sliders) for refining service lists or product catalogues. Applied filters should be clearly visible.
*   **Account Management:** Easy access to profile details, booking history, membership status, Token balance, and redemption options within a clearly structured dashboard.

## 4. Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

*   **Overall Feel:** Professional, efficient, trustworthy, technologically advanced, clean, bright.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary Backgrounds:** Clean whites (#FFFFFF) and light greys (#F4F4F7 or similar) dominate to create a bright, uncluttered feel.
    *   **Primary Accent:** A trustworthy, modern blue (#007AFF or similar) or teal (#1ABC9C or similar) used for key calls-to-action, interactive elements, icons, and potentially headings or data visualization accents.
    *   **Secondary Accents:** Neutral greys for text (#333333 or similar for body, lighter greys for secondary info), borders, and subtle UI elements. A secondary, complementary accent color might be used very sparingly for specific highlights (e.g., success states - green, alerts - yellow/orange).
*   **Imagery:** High-quality, original photography and videography. Focus on clean shots of the environment, technology in use (presented clearly), professional team members, and potentially abstract representations of results or benefits. Avoid overly "lifestyle" or cluttered imagery.
*   **Iconography Style:** Clean, precise line icons (stroked, not filled generally). Consistent line weight and style across the entire icon set.

## 5. Mobile, Web App, Desktop considerations

*   **Mobile-First:** Design originates from the mobile viewport constraints, ensuring core functionality and content hierarchy work effectively on small screens. Navigation collapses into a standard mobile menu (hamburger or similar). Touch targets are appropriately sized.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout fluidly adapts across tablet and desktop breakpoints, utilizing the grid system to rearrange and resize components effectively. No loss of information or functionality.
*   **Web App Aspects (Account/Booking):** The user account dashboard and booking flow should feel particularly application-like â€“ efficient, task-oriented, and highly responsive, potentially using more dynamic component loading than static informational pages.

## 6. Typography

*   **Font Family:** Modern, highly legible sans-serif typeface(s) suitable for both English and Chinese rendering (e.g., Noto Sans, Inter, SF Pro Display, PingFang HK/SC depending on licensing and technical implementation). Prioritize clarity and readability at various sizes.
*   **Hierarchy:** Clear typographic scale established using font size, weight (e.g., Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold/Bold), and color to differentiate headings (H1, H2, H3...), body text, labels, captions, etc. Consistent line height and spacing improve readability.
*   **Language Considerations:** Ensure chosen fonts have excellent character support for Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and English. Test line lengths and layout adjustments needed for different language densities.

## 7. Accessibility

*   **WCAG Compliance:** Target WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
*   **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors, and for UI components, per WCAG guidelines.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be navigable and operable using a keyboard. Focus states must be clear and highly visible.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** Use semantic HTML markup (headings, landmarks, ARIA attributes where necessary) to ensure compatibility with screen readers. Provide text alternatives (alt text) for all informative images and icons.
*   **Forms:** Associate labels correctly with form inputs. Provide clear instructions and error messages.
