# Project Management Plan

## Project Overview
This project is a frontend prototype with a memory management component (MCP) that provides persistent storage of project information. The project is currently in prototyping mode, focusing on developing the frontend interface without connecting to backend logic.

## Development Guidelines

### General Guidelines
- We are in prototyping mode - focus on frontend development only
- Use dummy JSON to represent data
- Link all components for navigation
- Make buttons responsive
- Don't connect to backend logic
- Always check the problems window for issues and fix them

### Memory MCP Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **IMPORTANT**: Always add to memory MCP by calling "npm run memory-add-conversation" after 20 tool calls or 25 conversations
- This is a critical requirement to maintain project context and knowledge

### Memory MCP Usage
- Use `npm run memory-add-conversation` to add conversations to memory
- Check memory service health with `npm run memory-check`
- Initialize memory with `npm run memory-init` if needed
- Start memory service with `npm run memory-stub` or `npm run memory-start`

### Code Structure
- Follow the recommended file structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── layout.tsx
  │   ├── page.tsx
  │   └── [feature]/
  │       ├── page.tsx
  │       ├── layout.tsx
  │       └── _components/
  ├── ui/               # Base Shadcn components
  ├── components/       # Composed reusable components
  ├── features/         # Feature-specific components
  ├── public/           # Static assets
  ├── styles/           # Global CSS
  └── next.config.js
  ```

### Component Development
- Use 'use client' directive for client-side components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use shadcn components where possible
- Use lucide-react for icons

### Database Integration (For Future Reference)
- Use Prisma as the only database client
- Keep database logic in dedicated service layers
- Use Prisma's type-safe queries

### Authentication (For Future Reference)
- Use Clerk for authentication
- Use clerkMiddleware (not deprecated authMiddleware)
- Protect /app routes in middleware

### Testing
- Add newly changed features to Playwright tests
- Run full Playwright regression tests after each change
- Fix any negative test results
- Terminate lingering Playwright report server processes before running tests again
- Update test selectors when component implementations change (like with TreatmentImage)
- Available test scripts:
  - `npm test`: Run all Playwright tests
  - `npm run test:ui`: Run tests with Playwright UI mode
  - `npm run test:debug`: Run tests in debug mode
  - `npm run test:report`: Show the Playwright HTML report

### Git Commit Messages
- Follow the prefix convention:
  - "Feat(component): add new component"
  - "Fix(api): fix api error"
  - "Docs(readme): update readme"
  - "Refactor(utils): refactor utils"
  - "Style(tailwind): add new tailwind class"
