Also added CMS development as part of Phase 3 Feature Development and created new Phase 5 for Advanced Features including membership, online shop, virtual consultation, AI skin analysis, and payment integration. Extended Backlog Tasks to include more CMS features like membership tier management, loyalty token configuration, and order management."

Implemented the main dashboard page with statistics and recent activities. Developed a services management page with filtering, sorting, and CRUD actions. Created a service form with multilingual support (English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese) and all required fields including media uploads. Used shadcn UI components for consistent design, and implemented client-side validation and mock data structures for prototyping."

        "In our recent work, we successfully fixed a routing conflict in the Next.js application. The issue was caused by conflicting dynamic route parameters between two files: src/app/admin/blog/edit/[id]/page.tsx and src/app/admin/blog/edit/[slug]/page.tsx. Next.js does not allow different slug names for the same dynamic path. We resolved this by standardizing on the [id] parameter, moving the content from the [slug] file to the [id] file with appropriate parameter updates, and then deleting the [slug] file. We also had to clear the Next.js build cache by removing the .next directory. Additionally, we encountered issues with Google Fonts failing to load, causing slow page rendering, which we addressed by creating a .env.local file to disable Google Fonts during development. These changes have streamlined the routing system and improved development performance."

        "We identified and fixed a component error in the blog edit page. The admin blog edit page was trying to use the shadcn Tabs component which wasn't installed. We resolved this by installing the Tabs component using the command 'npx shadcn@latest add tabs', which created the necessary component file at src/components/ui/tabs.tsx. After installing the component, we restarted the development server to apply the changes. This highlights the importance of ensuring all required UI components are properly installed when building with shadcn/ui."

These changes ensure the admin interface functions properly without errors. Looking at the Project Management Plan, our next steps should focus on continuing the implementation of the CMS functionality for content management, as outlined in the Pending Tasks section."
