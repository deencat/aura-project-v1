        "In our recent work, we successfully fixed a routing conflict in the Next.js application. The issue was caused by conflicting dynamic route parameters between two files: src/app/admin/blog/edit/[id]/page.tsx and src/app/admin/blog/edit/[slug]/page.tsx. Next.js does not allow different slug names for the same dynamic path. We resolved this by standardizing on the [id] parameter, moving the content from the [slug] file to the [id] file with appropriate parameter updates, and then deleting the [slug] file. We also had to clear the Next.js build cache by removing the .next directory. Additionally, we encountered issues with Google Fonts failing to load, causing slow page rendering, which we addressed by creating a .env.local file to disable Google Fonts during development. These changes have streamlined the routing system and improved development performance."

We resolved this by installing the Tabs component using the command 'npx shadcn@latest add tabs', which created the necessary component file at src/components/ui/tabs.tsx. After installing the component, we restarted the development server to apply the changes. This highlights the importance of ensuring all required UI components are properly installed when building with shadcn/ui."

        "We investigated technical issues causing slow loading in the project. First, we found that Next.js was failing to load Google Fonts, creating long delays. We solved this by 1) Adding a .env.local file to disable Google Fonts, 2) Simplifying the font loading in layout.tsx to remove conditional logic that was causing errors, and 3) Installing missing shadcn/ui components (tabs, table, badge, alert-dialog, alert, navigation-menu) that were being imported but not installed. We also examined the carousel implementation used in treatment pages like laser-treatment and peeled-egg-skin, which uses the shadcn Carousel component with custom indicators and transitions. The PlaceholderImage component provides consistent image placeholders throughout the site with specific naming conventions for different page sections. These improvements help ensure faster loading and consistent styling across the site."
